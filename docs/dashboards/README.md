# Dashboards (registry + handoff)

This folder is the dashboard registry for:
- route ownership
- implementation status
- minimal copy-paste subsets

## Naming policy (to prevent route drift)

- Use **kebab-case** for route folder names in `apps/web/src/app`.
- Use **American spelling (`optimization`)** for core DB5 route family.
- Keep **`optimisation-algos`** as an intentional branded route for the G-Valley narrative.
- Do not introduce new mixed spellings unless there is a product naming reason documented in the dashboard spec.
